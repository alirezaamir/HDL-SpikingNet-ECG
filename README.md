## Simplified Abstract
The proposed algorithm focuses on real-time cardiac monitoring systems integrated into wearable devices that operate on extremely low energy levels. By employing STDP and R-STDP mechanisms, our model not only trains on the timing of spikes but also adjusts based on the rewards or punishments, significantly lowering the energy required for ECG signal classification to 1.78 μJ per beat—a reduction of up to nine orders of magnitude compared to conventional methods.

## Main Features
- **Ultra Low-Power Consumption**: Exceptionally efficient in energy use, suitable for continuous monitoring.
- **Real-Time Operation**: Designed to perform ECG classification effectively in real-time scenarios.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves competitive accuracy levels comparable to previous ECG classification algorithms.
